## MCP Server #1: Context7 (Documentation Lookup)

### Purpose
Retrieve official library documentation for Zustand state management to inform ADR 001 and validate React Native integration patterns.

### Usage Details

**Query**: Zustand library documentation with focus on React Native integration, store patterns, and middleware

**Library Resolved**: `/pmndrs/zustand` (Context7-compatible ID)
- **Trust Score**: 9.6/10 (highly authoritative)
- **Code Snippets**: 400 available examples
- **Documentation Coverage**: Comprehensive (persist middleware, slices pattern, TypeScript integration)

### Documentation Retrieved (2000 tokens)

**Key Patterns Identified**:

1. **AsyncStorage Persistence Pattern**
```typescript
import { persist, createJSONStorage } from 'zustand/middleware'

export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // state definition
    }),
    {
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage),
    },
  ),
)
```

2. **Slice Pattern for Feature Modularity**
```typescript
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (...a) => ({
      ...createBearSlice(...a),
      ...createFishSlice(...a),
    }),
    { name: 'bound-store' },
  ),
)
```

3. **TypeScript Integration with State Creator**
```typescript
import { create, StateCreator, StoreMutatorIdentifier } from 'zustand'

type Logger<T, Mps extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = [], Mcs extends [StoreMutatorIdentifier, unknown][] = []> = (
  f: StateCreator<T, Mps, Mcs>,
  name?: string,
) => StateCreator<T, Mps, Mcs>
```

4. **Custom Merge Function for Deep Objects**
```typescript
export const useBoundStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      foo: { bar: 0, baz: 1 },
    }),
    {
      merge: (persistedState, currentState) =>
        deepMerge(currentState, persistedState),
    },
  ),
)
```

## MCP Server #2: Sequential (Complex Analysis)

### Purpose
Multi-step architectural analysis for technology stack decisions, MVVM-C design, and scalability planning.

### Usage Details

**Analysis Workflow**: 8-step sequential thinking process

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Mental wellness app with 8 core features
- Security requirements (encryption, HIPAA-compliance)
- Offline-first architecture
- Cross-platform (iOS + Android)
- International expansion planning

### Sequential Thinking Breakdown

#### Thought 1: Requirements Analysis
**Context**: Analyzed mental wellness app requirements including offline-first, encryption, HIPAA-compliance, 8 core features.

**Key Insights**:
- AsyncStorage + SecureStorageService two-tier architecture needed
- Zustand persistence critical for offline UX
- Biometric authentication required for sensitive data
- State synchronization across 8 feature modules

#### Thought 2: State Management Decision
**Context**: Evaluated Zustand vs. Redux vs. Context for mental health data.

**Decision Factors**:
- createJSONStorage with AsyncStorage for offline persistence
- Persist middleware for automatic state hydration
- Slice pattern matches 8 feature modules
- No provider wrapping (simpler than Redux)

**Outcome**: Zustand selected with AsyncStorage persistence layer

#### Thought 3: Navigation Architecture
**Context**: Designed navigation for tab-based UI + stack navigation + modal crisis access.

**Requirements Identified**:
- 5 main tabs (Home, Wellness, Journal, Tools, Profile)
- Stack navigation within each tab
- Modal for crisis plan (emergency access)
- Type-safe routing with TypeScript
- Coordinator pattern compliance

**Outcome**: React Navigation v6 with Native Stack + Bottom Tabs

#### Thought 4: Data Persistence & Encryption
**Context**: Analyzed HIPAA requirements, encryption needs, offline storage.

**Critical Considerations**:
- Therapeutic journaling requires end-to-end encryption
- Two-tier storage: AsyncStorage (non-sensitive) + Keychain (encrypted)
- AES-256 encryption via SecureStorageService
- Biometric authentication gates for sensitive data

**Outcome**: Two-tier storage architecture with encryption

#### Thought 5: MVVM-C Feature Structure
**Context**: Designed 8 feature modules with proper MVVM-C separation.

**Feature Architecture**:
1. ConversationPrompts: Model (Prompt, UserResponse), ViewModel, Views, Service
2. FamilyExercises: MVVM structure
3. WellnessLogs: Model (MoodEntry, WellnessLog), ViewModel (mood tracking)
4. TherapeuticJournal: Model (encrypted), SecureJournalService, Views
5. BreathingTools: Model (BreathingExercise, Session), ViewModel, Views
6. CrisisPlan: Model (CrisisPlan, EmergencyContact), ViewModel, Views
7. AIGuide (optional): Model (Conversation, Message), AIService
8. Analytics: Model (InsightData), ViewModel, Views

**Outcome**: Self-contained feature modules with clear MVVM-C boundaries

#### Thought 6: LitmonCloud Service Integration
**Context**: Planned integration with framework services.

**Services Available**:
- AuthService (JWT, biometric)
- SecureStorageService (encrypted storage)
- NetworkService (Axios with retry)
- BiometricService (Face ID, Touch ID)
- DeviceSecurityService (jailbreak detection)

**Integration Strategy**:
- Service adapters in src/core/services/
- Dependency injection via ViewModels
- Service initialization via AppBootstrap
- Type-safe service interfaces

**Outcome**: Comprehensive service integration architecture

#### Thought 7: Scalability & Internationalization
**Context**: Defined scalability strategy for growth.

**Scalability Requirements**:
- Offline-first (all features work without network)
- Modular feature architecture
- Code splitting via React.lazy
- Pagination for large datasets
- Memory-efficient media handling

**Internationalization**:
- react-i18next for multi-language
- RTL support (Arabic/Hebrew)
- Cultural sensitivity in mental health content
- Region-specific crisis resources

**Performance Targets**: <3s load on 3G, <100MB memory, 60fps UI, <500KB initial bundle

#### Thought 8: Implementation Phases
**Context**: Synthesized architectural decisions into 5 implementation phases.

**Phased Approach**:
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Foundation, authentication, navigation, services
- Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7): Core features (Wellness, Journal, Conversation)
- Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10): Tools & Safety (Breathing, Crisis Plan)
- Phase 4 (Weeks 11-13): Advanced features (Family, AI, Analytics)
- Phase 5 (Weeks 14-16): i18n, testing, app store prep

**Quality Gates**: Tests passing, TypeScript compliance, accessibility audit, performance benchmarks

**Outcome**: 16-week technical implementation plan
